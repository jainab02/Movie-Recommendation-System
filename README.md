# IMDb Movie Recommendation System using NLP

This repository contains a text classification model for sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The IMDb dataset consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the review.

The model is built using Python and various NLP libraries, including Keras and Numpy. It employs a combination of preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and a machine learning algorithm to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Dataset

The IMDb dataset can be obtained from the keras library itself. It is the inbuilt dataset provided with keras. It contains a collection of movie data along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, allowing us to train the model on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen samples.

## Feature Extraction

To represent the textual data numerically, we extract features from the preprocessed text. Common feature extraction techniques used for text classification include:

1. Bag-of-Words: Each review is represented as a vector of word frequencies.
2. TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency assigns weights to each word based on its importance in the document and the entire corpus.

## Model Training

For classification, we train a machine learning algorithm on the extracted features. Popular algorithms for text classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This repository provides an example implementation using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

## Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance and generalization ability.And lastly the accuracy is defined.

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Download the IMDb dataset or use your own labeled text data.
3. Preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing techniques.
4. Extract features from the preprocessed data.
5. Train the classification model on the extracted features.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
7. Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen movie reviews.
